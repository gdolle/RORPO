= RORPO

The RORPO library provides filtering and segmentation based on 
Ranking Orientation Responses of Path Openings

== Usage

See `RORPO_multiscale_Usage --help` command.

WARNING: All images are expected to have an isotropic image resolution (cubic voxels).
The software will produce a result if this not the case but the interpretation
of this result will be questionable.

== Installation

=== From sources

Install the required dependencies beforehand. Then in a terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/path-openings/RORPO.git && cd RORPO
git submodule update --init --recursive

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
make install
```

== Headers

=== File `PO.hpp`

PO_3D : 
Compute the Path Opening operator in one orientation. The 7 orientations are defined in the function createNeighbourhood.

|===
| image        | Input image 
| L            | Path length
| index_image  | sorted index of the image. Result of the sort_image_value function of sorting.hpp 
| orientations | defined the orientation used. Choices are [0,0,1] ; [1,0,0] ; [0,1,0] ; [1,1,1] ; [-1,1,1] ; [1,1,-1] ; [-1,1,-1]
| Output       | Result of the Path Opening
|===	

=== File `RPO.hpp`

RPO :
Compute the 7 orientations of the Robust Path Opening and return them.

|===
| image   | input image
| L       | Path length
| RPO1    | resulting Robust Path Opening in the first orientation.
| RPO2    | resulting Robust Path Opening in the second orientation
| RPO3    | resulting Robust Path Opening in the third orientation
| RPO4    | resulting Robust Path Opening in the fourth orientation
| RPO5    | resulting Robust Path Opening in the fifth orientation
| RPO6    | resulting Robust Path Opening in the sixth orientation
| RPO7    | resulting Robust Path Opening in the seventh orientation
| nb_core | number of cores used to compute the Path Opening (choose between 1 and 7)
|===

=== File `RORPO.hpp` 

Compute the Ranking Orientations Responses of Path Operators (RORPO)

|===
| image | input image
| L | Path length
| nb_core | number of cores used to compute the Path Opening (choose between 1 and 7)
|===	

=== File RORPO_multiscale.hpp

Compute the multiscale RORPO

|===
| image      | input image
| S_list     | vector containing the different path length (scales)
| nb_core    | number of cores used to compute the Path Opening (choose between 1 and 7)
| debug_flag | 1 (activated) or 0 (desactivated)
| Mask       | optional mask image
